Before we review how *you*
can create your own simple slides...

We need to review how
**Simple Slides** itself
works

**Simple Slides** is based on
the Takahashi Method

The [Takahashi Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method)
is a way to present simple and elegant slides
that favor text content

With **Simple Slides**, each slide will expand
the content to its
maximum possible size

Based on your browser window

Resize your window and try it!

See!

This style means less content
per slide

And faster changing of slides

Both of which keep
your audience engaged

The layout is handled
automatically

So you can focus more
on the content itself

**Simple Slides** uses
**markdown** to render your slides

So you can do things like:

# Headings
On top of content

- bulleted
- lists

1. or numbered lists
1. if that's
1. how you roll

```
const code = "your nifty code here";
code++; // wat
```

And whatever else
markdown supports!

Notice the bar on the bottom
of the screen too

It measures your progress

You can refresh the page,
and your current slide will stick. Try it!

You can even share the URL,
and it will load at the current slide

Finally, there are a few more
hot keys than just the arrow keys:

```
j or l = go forward 1 slide
k or h = go back 1 slide
f = go forward 5 slides
b = go back 5 slides
0 = go to start
$ = go to end
```

Now, let's show you
how to use **Simple Slides**
for your own slides!

There's only 2 steps:

1. Create a markdown file
somewhere with a public URL

The file can exist anywhere

[These instructions](/instructions.md) themselves are
a markdown file, so you can use
them as an example

2. Click that settings button in the top right corner

<span>&#8599;&#65039;</span>
<br />Somewhere over there

Paste in the link to your markdown file

And click present

You did it!

[Here's an example](https://simpleslides.dev/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2Fsa3JhdXNzNDgvdGFsa3MvbWFzdGVyL3NoZWNvZGVzLXdvcmtzaG9wLWludHJvL3ByZXNlbnRhdGlvbi5tZA==) of
a different presentation

Don't worry, we sanitize your markdown
content

So your audience doesn't have to worry
about pesky cross-site scripting

Thanks for reading
these instructions!

You have a great
day now, buh bye

And go create something awesome!

Special thanks to my
original inspiration:

A similar desktop-only tool
called [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)

Now, the next slide is
the last slide for real
